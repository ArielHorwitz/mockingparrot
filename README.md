![Preview](preview.png)

## Getting started
Download a precompiled binary from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ArielHorwitz/mockingparrot/releases). Or, if you have the Rust toolchain then run:
```
cargo install mockingparrot
```

You will need to copy your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) into the config file.

Version upgrades may not be backward compatible: if you are upgrading to a newer version, you _may_ need to remove your config file or other saved data.
